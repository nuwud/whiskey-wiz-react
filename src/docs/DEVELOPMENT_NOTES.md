# Development Notes for WhiskeyWiz React

## Key Components Added/Updated

1. Core Game Components:
- GameResults.tsx - Score visualization and detailed results
- QuarterSelection.tsx - Quarter selection interface
- SampleGuessing.tsx - Main game interaction component

2. UI Components:
- badge.tsx - Badge component for status indicators
- button.tsx - Reusable button component
- progress.tsx - Progress tracking component
- dropdown-menu.tsx - Navigation and action menus

3. Infrastructure:
- ErrorBoundary.tsx - Global error handling
- LoadingState.tsx - Unified loading states
- OnboardingFlow.tsx - User onboarding experience

## Critical Dependencies
```json
{
  "@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu": "^2.0.6",
  "@radix-ui/react-progress": "^1.0.3",
  "@radix-ui/react-slot": "^1.0.2",
  "class-variance-authority": "^0.7.0",
  "recharts": "^2.9.0"
}
```

## Important Configuration Notes:

1. Firebase Configuration
- Uses Next.js environment variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_*)
- Requires proper Firebase setup in firebaseConfig.ts
- Deployment uses Firebase Hosting with Next.js

2. Build Process
- Ensure all components that use React hooks are marked with "use client"
- Next.js app router is used by default
- Firebase deployment needs proper hosting configuration

3. State Management
- Uses React Context for global state
- Firebase Auth for authentication
- Local state for game mechanics

## Known Issues/TODO:
1. Need to complete dropdown-menu.tsx implementation
2. Build process needs refinement for Firebase deployment
3. Some UI components need better TypeScript definitions

## Critical Paths:
- /app/game - Main game flow
- /app/auth - Authentication
- /app/admin - Admin dashboard

## Next Steps:
1. Complete component implementations
2. Add comprehensive testing
3. Refine deployment process
4. Add analytics tracking

## Lessons Learned:
1. GitHub API usage requires proper base64 encoding for content
2. Next.js 14 requires "use client" directives for components using hooks
3. Firebase deployment needs specific configuration for Next.js
4. Keep all file changes in git for proper tracking
5. Test builds locally before deployment

## For Next Chat:
1. Start with checking the build process
2. Complete dropdown-menu.tsx implementation
3. Add remaining UI components
4. Implement comprehensive testing
5. Set up proper deployment pipeline
