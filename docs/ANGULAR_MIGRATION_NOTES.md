## 🎯 Key Differences and Migration Notes

1. **Component Architecture**
   - Angular: Uses `@Component` decorators
   - React: Uses functional components with hooks

2. **State Management**
   - Angular: Services and RxJS
   - React: React Hooks (useState, useContext) and potentially Redux/Zustand

3. **Routing**
   - Angular: Angular Router
   - React: React Router

4. **Firebase Integration**
   - Maintain similar service structure
   - Update authentication and data fetching methods

5. **Web Components**
   - Angular: Native web component support
   - React: Use custom element creation techniques

## 🚧 Migration Checklist

- [ ] Recreate base quarter component structure
- [ ] Port Firebase services
- [ ] Implement React routing
- [ ] Convert component templates
- [ ] Replicate authentication flow
- [ ] Rebuild admin interfaces
- [ ] Ensure feature parity

## 📝 Specific Angular Features to Replicate
